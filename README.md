# Geodatabase Update Script

This Python script updates a geodatabase with features from shapefiles, based on a specified ID field.

## Usage

1. Place your shapefiles in a folder.
2. Create or specify an existing geodatabase where the features will be updated.
3. Update the `shp_directory`, `gdb_directory`, and `id_field` variables in the script as needed.
4. Run the script using the command:

   ```python
   python geodatabase_update.py
   
## Script Explanation

The script `geodatabase_update.py` performs the following steps:

- Sets up the environment by defining the shapefile directory (`shp_directory`), geodatabase directory (`gdb_directory`), and ID field (`id_field`).
- Lists all shapefiles (`*.shp`) in the specified shapefile directory.
- Iterates through each shapefile:
  - Checks if the corresponding feature class exists in the geodatabase.
  - Compares the feature IDs in the shapefile with the feature IDs in the geodatabase.
  - Deletes features from the geodatabase if they are not present in the shapefile.
  - Appends new features from the shapefile to the geodatabase.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- ArcPy library (included with ArcGIS Desktop installation)

Ensure you have ArcGIS installed, as ArcPy is required for this script to work.

Feel free to modify the script to suit your specific requirements or add more functionality.
